## Singleton Example

### Eager Initialization
#### Pros
* it's straightforward and cleaner
* it's the opposite of the lazy initialization but still thread safe
* it has a small lag time when the application is in execution mode 
#### Cons
* It's takes longer to start, because everything need to be loaded first


### Lazy Initialization
